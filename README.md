# Supplementary Materials for the book *Agentic AI Primer: Foundations of Autonomous Intelligent Systems*

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the supplementary materials accompanying *Agentic AI Primer: Foundations of Autonomous Intelligent Systems* (First Edition 2025) by Dr Mahesha BR Pandit.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as the comprehensive companion to *Agentic AI Primer: Foundations of Autonomous Intelligent Systems*. It is designed to provide readers with practical, hands-on resources that complement the theoretical foundations and concepts presented in the book.

The materials here include a wide range of code examples, from concise snippets that can be easily integrated into your own projects to fully executable programs that demonstrate key algorithms, architectures, and workflows related to autonomous intelligent systems. By working through these examples, readers can deepen their understanding of agentic AI principles and gain practical experience implementing autonomous agents.

The repository is carefully organized to mirror the structure of the book, with each chapter’s code and resources contained within its own directory. This organization facilitates easy navigation and allows readers to quickly find the relevant materials corresponding to the chapter they are studying.

In addition to code, this repository also maintains an errata section where known errors, clarifications, and updates to the book are documented. Readers are encouraged to check this section regularly and contribute by reporting any issues or suggestions via GitHub’s issue tracker.

Whether you are a student, researcher, or practitioner in the field of artificial intelligence, this repository aims to be a valuable resource that bridges the gap between theory and practice in agentic AI.

## Repository Structure

- `chapter1/` — Code and examples for Chapter 1
